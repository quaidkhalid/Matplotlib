This repo is all about exploring the powerful capabilities of Matplotlib, a popular Python library for data visualization. Here, I experimented with various types of graphs to visualize different datasets, helping to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
In this project, I explored the Matplotlib library to create a wide range of visualizations, such as:

Line Chart - Visualizing trends over time.
Bar Graph - Comparing values across categories.
Scatter Plot - Showing correlations between two variables.
Histogram - Analyzing the distribution of data.
Boxplot - Showing IQR and outliers.
